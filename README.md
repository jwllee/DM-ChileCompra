# DM-ChileCompra
Data Mining project on the public tender data of public institutes and organizations at the ChileCompra platform.

This was a group data mining project for my data mining course but the explored data has real research potential. However, we faced many challenges and learned a ton during this project. One big problem with this data is with the data quality, substantial preprocessing is required before having a workable dataset.
